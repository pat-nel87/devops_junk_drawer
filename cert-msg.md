We want to configure our Kubernetes cluster issuer to integrate with DigiCert's ACME v2 protocol endpoint instead of Let's Encrypt's ACME server, enabling automated provisioning and lifecycle management of DigiCert-issued domain-validated public certificates through our existing cert-manager infrastructure. This change will transition our PKI certificate authority from Let's Encrypt's free service to DigiCert's enterprise-grade certificate authority while maintaining the same automated certificate request, validation, issuance, and renewal workflow that our cluster issuer currently orchestrates. The DigiCert ACME service will perform the same domain control validation process but issue certificates from DigiCert's trusted root certificate authority, which provides enhanced commercial support, service level agreements, and enterprise-grade certificate management capabilities for our TLS-secured microservices communication and Application Gateway Ingress Controller endpoints. This maintains our existing public key infrastructure automation while upgrading to a premium certificate authority that offers better alignment with enterprise security requirements and commercial support structures.
