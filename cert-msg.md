We want to configure our Kubernetes cluster issuer to integrate with DigiCert's ACME v2 protocol endpoint instead of Let's Encrypt's ACME server, enabling automated provisioning and lifecycle management of DigiCert-issued domain-validated public certificates through our existing cert-manager infrastructure. This change will transition our PKI certificate authority from Let's Encrypt's free service to DigiCert's enterprise-grade certificate authority while maintaining the same automated certificate request, validation, issuance, and renewal workflow that our cluster issuer currently orchestrates. The DigiCert ACME service will perform the same domain control validation process but issue certificates from DigiCert's trusted root certificate authority, which provides enhanced commercial support, service level agreements, and enterprise-grade certificate management capabilities for our TLS-secured microservices communication and Application Gateway Ingress Controller endpoints. This maintains our existing public key infrastructure automation while upgrading to a premium certificate authority that offers better alignment with enterprise security requirements and commercial support structures.


We need to address a critical data persistence issue with our CouchDB deployment in AKS. Azure automatically replaces or restarts AKS nodes during routine maintenance (security patches, node image updates, cluster upgrades, and health management), which will cause complete data loss for any stateful applications like CouchDB that don't use Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs). While we could implement PVCs to solve the immediate data loss risk, running databases in Kubernetes introduces significant operational overhead including backup management, high availability configuration, security patching, performance tuning, and disaster recovery planning. Given these complexities and the business-critical nature of our data, I recommend migrating to Azure's managed database services (such as Azure Cosmos DB or Azure Database for PostgreSQL), which provide built-in HA, automated backups, security compliance, and eliminate the operational burden while reducing our overall risk of data loss and downtime.
