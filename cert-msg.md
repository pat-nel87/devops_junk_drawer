Immediate Cost Reduction Strategies
Consolidate NAT Gateways

You don't need one NAT Gateway per VNet. A single NAT Gateway can serve multiple subnets within the same VNet, and even across VNets in the same region via VNet peering
Consider using one NAT Gateway per region instead of per VNet, especially for non-prod environments

Review Your Outbound Traffic Patterns

NAT Gateway charges are primarily for data processing (outbound traffic) - around $0.045 per GB processed
Identify what's generating outbound traffic: OS updates, logging, monitoring, backup traffic, etc.
Consider if some workloads really need dedicated outbound internet access
