# Linguistics Quiz Study Guide

## 1. Morphology (Chapter 4)

### Derivation (4.1–4.1.2)

**Definition**: Derivation uses morphemes to create new words by changing meaning or part of speech.

**Derivational morphemes** are affixes that:
- Create new lexical items
- Often change the grammatical category
- Can change the core meaning

**Examples**:
- *teach* (verb) → *teacher* (noun) [adds -er]
- *happy* (adjective) → *unhappy* (adjective) [adds un-, changes meaning]
- *nation* (noun) → *national* (adjective) → *nationalize* (verb)
- *kind* (adjective) → *kindness* (noun)

### Inflection (4.1.3)

**Definition**: Inflection uses morphemes to express grammatical relationships without creating new words.

**Inflectional morphemes**:
- Do NOT change the part of speech
- Express grammatical features
- Are more regular and predictable than derivational morphemes

**Key grammatical features expressed**:
- **Tense**: *walk* → *walked* (past tense)
- **Number**: *cat* → *cats* (plural)
- **Agreement**: *she walk**s*** (3rd person singular)
- **Case**: *I* → *me* (objective case)
- **Comparison**: *tall* → *taller* → *tallest*

**English inflectional morphemes** (only 8 total):
- Plural: -s
- Possessive: -'s
- 3rd person singular present: -s
- Past tense: -ed
- Past participle: -ed/-en
- Present participle: -ing
- Comparative: -er
- Superlative: -est

### Free Morphemes and Content Morphemes

**Free morphemes**: Can stand alone as complete words
- Examples: *cat*, *run*, *happy*, *in*

**Bound morphemes**: Must attach to other morphemes
- Examples: *-ed*, *un-*, *-ness*, *-s*

**Content morphemes** (lexical morphemes):
- Carry primary lexical meaning
- Open class (new ones can be added)
- Include: nouns, verbs, adjectives, most adverbs
- Examples: *dog*, *beautiful*, *quickly*, *think*

**Function morphemes** (grammatical morphemes):
- Serve grammatical purposes
- Closed class (fixed set)
- Include: determiners, prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns
- Examples: *the*, *of*, *and*, *she*, *to*

### Morphological Types of Languages (4.3)

**1. Analytic Languages**
- Few or no bound morphemes
- Meaning conveyed primarily through word order and separate words
- Low morpheme-per-word ratio
- Example: **Mandarin Chinese**
  - 我 看 书 (wǒ kàn shū) = "I read book" (each morpheme is a separate word)

**2. Synthetic Languages**
- Words contain multiple morphemes
- Higher morpheme-per-word ratio
- Two main subtypes:

**2a. Agglutinating Languages**
- Morphemes joined together with clear boundaries
- Each morpheme typically expresses one meaning
- Morphemes easily segmented
- Example: **Turkish**
  - *ev-ler-im-de* = "in my houses"
  - *ev* (house) + *-ler* (plural) + *-im* (my) + *-de* (in)

**2b. Fusional Languages**
- Morphemes may encode multiple meanings simultaneously
- Boundaries between morphemes less clear
- Single morpheme can mark multiple features
- Example: **Spanish**
  - *hablo* = "I speak" (-o marks both 1st person AND singular AND present)
- Example: **Latin**
  - *puell-arum* = "of the girls" (-arum marks genitive case AND plural)

**3. Polysynthetic Languages**
- Highly complex words with many morphemes
- Single word can express what would be a full sentence in English
- Very high morpheme-per-word ratio
- Example: **Inuktitut**
  - Single words can mean "I am going to hunt caribou"

**Note**: Languages exist on a continuum and often show features of multiple types.

## 2. Morphological Change (Chapter 13: 13.4)

**Morphological change**: How word structure and morpheme systems change over time.

### Proportional Analogy

**Definition**: New forms created based on patterns in existing forms.

**Mechanism**: If A:B :: C:X, then X is created by analogy

**Examples**:
- Historic irregular: *work* : *wrought* (past)
- Modern regular pattern: *walk* : *walked*
- By analogy: *work* : *worked* (new regular form replaces *wrought*)

- Child language: *go* : *went* :: *bring* : *bringed* (instead of *brought*)

**Result**: Often creates regularization of irregular forms

### Paradigm Leveling

**Definition**: Reduction of irregularities within a paradigm to create more uniform patterns.

**Purpose**: Simplifies morphological systems by removing alternations

**Examples**:
- Old English had multiple plural forms; Modern English mainly uses *-s*
- Verb paradigms become more regular over time
- *help/holp/holpen* → *help/helped/helped*

**Effect**: Makes language more regular and predictable, reducing cognitive load

## 3. Syntax (Chapter 5)

### Relationship between Syntax and Semantics (5.1)

**Syntax**: The structure and arrangement of words in sentences

**Semantics**: The meaning of linguistic expressions

**Key relationship**: Syntactic structure directly affects interpretation

**Structural ambiguity**: Same words, different structures = different meanings

**Example**:
- "I saw the man with the telescope"
  - Structure 1: I used a telescope to see the man
  - Structure 2: I saw a man who had a telescope

**Example**:
- "Visiting relatives can be boring"
  - Structure 1: Going to visit relatives [gerund phrase as subject]
  - Structure 2: Relatives who are visiting [noun phrase as subject]

**Principle**: Different syntactic structures yield different semantic interpretations even with identical words.

### Syntactic Constituency (5.3)

**Definition**: Syntactic constituency is the grouping of words into hierarchical structural units (constituents).

**Constituent**: A group of words that functions as a single unit in syntactic structure.

**Why it matters**: Constituents can be manipulated as units (moved, replaced, coordinated).

#### Tests for Constituency

**1. Substitution Test**
- Replace a group of words with a single word (usually a pronoun)
- If substitution works, it's likely a constituent

Example:
- "The tall student" → "She" ✓ (constituent)
- "Tall student from" → cannot substitute (not a constituent)

**2. Movement Test**
- Move a group of words to another position
- If it can move as a unit, it's a constituent

Example:
- "Mary bought [a new car]" → "[A new car], Mary bought" ✓
- "Mary bought a" → "A Mary bought new car" ✗

**3. Coordination Test**
- Coordinate (join with *and*, *or*, *but*) with a similar structure
- Only constituents of the same type can be coordinated

Example:
- "Mary bought [a book] and [a pen]" ✓
- "Mary bought a" and "pen new" ✗

**4. Stand-alone Test**
- Can the phrase answer a question by itself?

Example:
- Q: "What did Mary buy?" A: "A new car" ✓ (constituent)

### Syntactic Categories in English (5.4)

#### Major Lexical Categories (Open Class)

**1. Noun (N)**
- Definition: Names persons, places, things, ideas
- Properties: Can be plural, can take determiners, can be possessive
- Examples: *dog*, *happiness*, *London*, *student*

**2. Verb (V)**
- Definition: Expresses actions, states, events
- Properties: Can be inflected for tense, takes subjects
- Examples: *run*, *think*, *seem*, *eat*

**3. Adjective (Adj)**
- Definition: Describes or modifies nouns
- Properties: Can be comparative/superlative, can follow *very*
- Examples: *happy*, *red*, *tall*, *interesting*

**4. Adverb (Adv)**
- Definition: Modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs
- Properties: Many end in *-ly*, express manner, time, place, degree
- Examples: *quickly*, *very*, *yesterday*, *here*

**5. Preposition (P)**
- Definition: Shows relationships between nouns/pronouns and other words
- Properties: Takes noun phrase complements, expresses location/time/direction
- Examples: *in*, *on*, *at*, *with*, *from*

**6. Determiner (Det)**
- Definition: Specifies/identifies nouns
- Properties: Precedes nouns, limited set
- Examples: *the*, *a*, *this*, *some*, *every*

#### Functional Categories (Closed Class)

**7. Auxiliary Verb (Aux)**
- Function: Helps main verb express tense, aspect, mood
- Examples: *is*, *have*, *will*, *can*, *must*, *do*

**8. Complementizer (C)**
- Function: Introduces complement clauses
- Examples: *that*, *if*, *whether*, *for*
- Example in sentence: "I know [**that** you are right]"

**9. Conjunction (Conj)**
- Function: Connects words, phrases, or clauses
- Examples: *and*, *but*, *or*, *nor*

**10. Pronoun (Pro)**
- Function: Replaces nouns/noun phrases
- Examples: *she*, *they*, *it*, *who*, *myself*

## 4. Syntactic Change (Chapter 13: 13.5)

**Definition**: Changes in sentence structure and word order patterns over time.

### How Syntactic Change Occurs

**1. Internal developments**
- Language-internal pressures and processes
- Simplification or regularization
- Chain reactions from other changes

**2. Language contact**
- Influence from other languages
- Borrowing of syntactic patterns
- Bilingual communities

### Causes of Syntactic Change

**1. Language Contact**
- Speakers of different languages interact
- Syntactic patterns transfer between languages
- Example: English *going to* future influenced by contact situations

**2. Reanalysis**
- Speakers reinterpret the structure of expressions
- Surface form stays same, but underlying structure changes
- Example: *going to* → *gonna* (from main verb + purpose to auxiliary)

**3. Analogy**
- Extending patterns from one construction to another
- Creating uniformity in the system
- Example: Regularization of word order patterns

### Example of Syntactic Change

**Old English → Modern English word order**:
- Old English: More flexible word order (SOV and SVO possible)
- Modern English: Rigid SVO word order
- Change driven by loss of case markings (morphological change led to syntactic change)

## 5. Practice Questions & Answers

### Q1: Explain the difference between derivation and inflection with examples.

**Answer**: 

Derivation creates new words by changing meaning or part of speech using derivational morphemes. Example: *teach* (verb) → *teacher* (noun), or *happy* → *unhappy* (changes meaning but not category).

Inflection modifies words to express grammatical features without changing the core meaning or part of speech. Example: *walk* → *walked* (adds past tense), *cat* → *cats* (adds plural number).

Key difference: Derivation creates new lexical items; inflection creates grammatical variants of the same word.

### Q2: Define free morpheme, content morpheme, and function morpheme.

**Answer**:

- **Free morpheme**: A morpheme that can stand alone as a complete word (e.g., *cat*, *run*, *the*)

- **Content morpheme**: A morpheme that carries primary lexical meaning, typically nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs (e.g., *dog*, *beautiful*, *think*)

- **Function morpheme**: A morpheme that serves grammatical purposes rather than carrying lexical content, including determiners, prepositions, and conjunctions (e.g., *the*, *of*, *and*)

### Q3: Describe the four major morphological types of languages and give examples.

**Answer**:

1. **Analytic**: Few bound morphemes; meaning through word order and separate words (e.g., Mandarin Chinese)

2. **Agglutinating**: Multiple morphemes joined with clear boundaries; each morpheme has one meaning (e.g., Turkish: *ev-ler-im-de* = "in my houses")

3. **Fusional**: Morphemes encode multiple meanings simultaneously; boundaries less clear (e.g., Spanish: *hablo* where *-o* marks person, number, and tense)

4. **Polysynthetic**: Highly complex words with many morphemes; single words can express full sentences (e.g., Inuktitut)

### Q4: Explain proportional analogy and paradigm leveling in morphological change.

**Answer**:

**Proportional analogy**: New forms created by extending existing patterns. If A:B :: C:X, then X is formed by analogy. Example: Since *walk*:*walked*, by analogy *work*:*worked* (replacing older *wrought*). This often regularizes irregular forms.

**Paradigm leveling**: Reduction of irregularities within a morphological paradigm to create uniformity. Example: Old English had many plural forms, but Modern English leveled most to the *-s* plural, simplifying the system and making it more regular.

### Q5: Describe the relationship between syntax and semantics.

**Answer**:

Syntax (sentence structure) directly affects semantics (meaning). Different syntactic structures can yield different interpretations even with identical words (structural ambiguity). 

Example: "I saw the man with the telescope" has two meanings depending on structure:
1. I used a telescope to see the man [telescope modifies *saw*]
2. I saw a man who possessed a telescope [telescope modifies *man*]

The hierarchical syntactic structure determines how we interpret the sentence.

### Q6: Define syntactic constituency and name two constituency tests.

**Answer**:

**Syntactic constituency**: The grouping of words into hierarchical structural units (constituents) that function as single units in syntactic operations.

**Two constituency tests**:

1. **Substitution test**: Replace a group of words with a single word (pronoun). If it works, it's a constituent. Example: "The tall student" → "She"

2. **Movement test**: Move a group of words to another position. If it can move as a unit, it's a constituent. Example: "Mary bought a new car" → "A new car, Mary bought"

(Other tests: coordination test, stand-alone test)

### Q7: List the syntactic categories in English and give one example for each.

**Answer**:

**Major categories**:
- **Noun**: *dog*
- **Verb**: *run*
- **Adjective**: *happy*
- **Adverb**: *quickly*
- **Preposition**: *in*
- **Determiner**: *the*

**Functional categories**:
- **Auxiliary**: *will*
- **Complementizer**: *that*
- **Conjunction**: *and*
- **Pronoun**: *she*

### Q8: Define syntactic change and describe one cause of it.

**Answer**:

**Syntactic change**: Changes in sentence structure and word order patterns over time.

**One cause - Reanalysis**: Speakers reinterpret the underlying structure of expressions while the surface form remains similar. 

Example: *going to* was reanalyzed from a main verb (*go*) + purpose clause to an auxiliary verb expressing future tense (*gonna*). The form looks similar, but the syntactic structure changed from [VERB + to-infinitive] to [AUXILIARY + infinitive].
