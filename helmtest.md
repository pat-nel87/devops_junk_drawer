üß™ What Are Helm Tests?
Helm tests are Kubernetes Jobs declared in a Helm chart under a special annotation:

yaml
Copy
Edit
annotations:
  "helm.sh/hook": test
They run in the cluster after a release is installed or upgraded via helm test <release-name> and are removed after execution (unless retained with --cleanup=false).

üß∞ How to Use Helm Tests
1. Add a test Job to your chart
In your Helm chart, create a file like templates/tests/test-connection.yaml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: "{{ .Release.Name }}-test-connection"
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: curl
    image: curlimages/curl
    command: ['curl']
    args: ['http://my-service:80']
  restartPolicy: Never
2. Run the test
After deploying the chart:

bash
Copy
Edit
helm test <release-name>
Use --logs to see test output:

bash
Copy
Edit
helm test <release-name> --logs
‚úÖ Common Use Cases
Use Case	Description
Connectivity Tests	Verify service endpoints are reachable post-deploy (e.g., via curl, nc).
Database Migrations	Run a migration script and ensure it finishes successfully.
Schema Verification	Check that database schema matches expectations.
Readiness Checks	Ensure the app is responding correctly to HTTP probes.
Smoke Tests	Run quick functional tests to validate key functionality.
Secrets/Config Validation	Ensure expected secrets/configs are mounted and valid.

‚úÖ Pros
In-cluster validation: Tests run in the same environment the app runs in.

Repeatable: Helm tests are idempotent, and can be re-run anytime.

Lightweight CI/CD gate: Acts as a post-deploy validation check.

Declarative: Tests are part of the Helm chart‚Äîversioned and repeatable.

Cluster visibility: Test jobs can exercise DNS, networking, config, and service mesh behavior.

‚ùå Cons
Not automatic: Tests don‚Äôt run on helm install or helm upgrade; must be explicitly invoked.

Lack of robust reporting: You need to parse logs or exit codes manually or with CI glue.

Can pollute cluster: If test Pods don‚Äôt clean up, they can linger.

Limited test logic: Helm tests are limited to what can run inside a Kubernetes Job‚Äîno native support for test frameworks.

Not ideal for complex integration tests: Larger test suites are better handled by tools like K6, Postman, or full CI pipelines with Kubernetes runners.

üîç When Should You Use Helm Tests?
Great for:

Lightweight integration checks

Deployment validation in dev/test clusters

Gatekeeping production rollouts (when integrated into pipelines)

Avoid for:

Heavy integration testing

Full end-to-end test suites

Security scanning, fuzzing, or performance testing

üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices
Always use restartPolicy: Never

Use lightweight containers (e.g., curlimages/curl, busybox)

Add --logs in automation to capture output

Annotate clearly and document what each test validates

Use helm test as a step in GitOps or CI workflows for promotion gates

Example Real-World Use Case
In a microservice Helm chart, you might add a test to:

Deploy the service

Verify it's listening on port 8080

Call /healthz endpoint via curl

Validate expected HTTP response (e.g., 200)

This ensures the service is live and wired correctly before promoting it further in a CD pipeline.

Would you like a working example chart with test jobs, or an integration pattern in a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)?









Ask ChatGPT
You said:
how can i drive helm tests with flux gitops? Can I tell it to run specify tests or will it run all tests I include in a chart by default? 


ChatGPT said:
Flux GitOps does not natively support Helm tests out of the box during reconciliation. Helm tests are designed to be run manually via helm test, and since Flux only installs or upgrades charts declaratively, it does not trigger post-deploy hooks like helm test.

However, you can drive Helm tests alongside Flux using automation‚Äîusually via a GitHub Actions pipeline or another orchestrator‚Äîafter Flux has successfully reconciled a HelmRelease.

üîÅ Why Flux Doesn‚Äôt Run Helm Tests
Flux uses the Helm SDK directly and does not execute Helm CLI commands like helm test. That means:

It renders the chart

It runs helm upgrade --install-style logic

It ignores Helm test hooks unless you explicitly run them elsewhere

üß† How to Integrate Helm Tests with Flux
üí° Strategy: Post-Flux Sync Hook
Let Flux deploy your HelmRelease

Wait for reconciliation to succeed

Run helm test via a pipeline, script, or external automation tool

This is often done in a CI/CD pipeline, such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Argo Workflows.

üß∞ Implementation Example: GitHub Actions
Here‚Äôs a simplified CI step after merging into a GitOps repo:

yaml
Copy
Edit
jobs:
  helm-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Wait for Flux reconciliation
        run: |
          flux reconcile hr <namespace>/<release-name>
          flux get hr <release-name> --namespace=<namespace> --watch

      - name: Run Helm tests
        run: |
          helm test <release-name> --namespace <namespace> --logs
üìù This assumes you:

Have access to the cluster (kubectl context)

Can authenticate to the cluster used by Flux

Have helm installed on the runner

üîç Can I Run Only Some Tests?
By default, helm test runs all tests annotated with:

yaml
Copy
Edit
metadata:
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": test
There‚Äôs no built-in Helm CLI flag to run a specific test Job (like you would a single pod). However:

Workaround Options:
Put logic in the test itself to run conditionally, using env or command args:

yaml
Copy
Edit
env:
  - name: TEST_TYPE
    value: smoke
Use separate Helm charts or values.yaml toggles to enable/disable specific test Jobs conditionally:

yaml
Copy
Edit
enabled: true
Run only one test job manually:

List Helm test jobs with kubectl get jobs -n <ns>

Run a Job manually if needed (this is not really using helm test, but can work).

üö´ Cons and Limitations
Limitation	Workaround
Flux doesn‚Äôt run tests	Use external automation (CI/CD)
Can‚Äôt target specific tests	Use logic inside test jobs
Helm test failures are not visible to Flux	Use helm test output in pipeline logs to fail builds

‚úÖ Summary
Feature	Supported in Flux HelmRelease?
Run all Helm tests	‚ùå Not natively supported
Run specific test only	‚ùå No native targeting
External automation	‚úÖ Yes, via CI tools
Use in GitOps flow	‚úÖ With post-sync scripting

Would you like a GitHub Actions template you can drop into your GitOps repo to run Helm tests after Flux reconciles a HelmRelease?








You said:
But can't I add the annotation via my helmrelease in flux to indicate testing?


ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî but not quite how it works. You can‚Äôt trigger Helm tests just by adding annotations to your HelmRelease in Flux.

Let‚Äôs clarify how it works and what the annotations on HelmRelease do vs what Helm test hooks are:

üîç Helm Test Hook ‚â† HelmRelease Annotations
Helm Test Jobs
You define them in your Helm chart templates as Kubernetes Jobs.

They must have this annotation in the Job manifest itself:

yaml
Copy
Edit
metadata:
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": test
This tells Helm to treat the Job as a test hook, run only when you execute:

bash
Copy
Edit
helm test <release>
HelmRelease Annotations in Flux
You can add annotations to your Flux HelmRelease, like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
metadata:
  annotations:
    foo: bar
But these are just metadata for the Kubernetes HelmRelease resource.

They don‚Äôt influence Helm behavior, nor do they tell Flux to run tests.

‚ùó Key Point
Flux does not run helm test, and no annotation in the HelmRelease will change that. The helm.sh/hook: test annotation must go on the test Job resources inside your Helm chart, and you still have to run helm test manually or via automation.

‚úÖ So What Can You Do in Flux?
You can:

Define your Helm tests inside the chart with proper test annotations

Deploy the chart with Flux

Then trigger the Helm tests externally, e.g., with a GitHub Actions job or Flux notification controller webhook

Optional Advanced Pattern: Helm Test Trigger via Flux Notification Controller
You can:

Use the Flux notification-controller to emit an event when a HelmRelease is ready

Trigger a webhook (e.g., GitHub Actions, Argo Workflows)

That webhook then runs helm test <release>

This gives you a semi-automated way to integrate tests into your GitOps lifecycle, even though Flux won‚Äôt run them directly.

Would you like a working example of this with GitHub Actions or how to write a test Job in your chart?








You said:
how can I use flux notification controller to trigger helm tests


ChatGPT said:
You can use Flux‚Äôs Notification Controller to trigger Helm tests indirectly by emitting an event when a HelmRelease has successfully reconciled, then using a webhook receiver to kick off a pipeline or script that runs helm test.

This allows you to chain Helm tests into your GitOps workflow, even though Flux doesn‚Äôt run them itself.

üß† High-Level Overview
‚úÖ HelmRelease is successfully reconciled

üì£ Notification Controller emits an event

üåê A Receiver catches the event and triggers a webhook

ü§ñ Your CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Argo Workflows) runs helm test <release>

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Guide
1. ‚úÖ Enable Alerting for Your HelmRelease
In your HelmRelease manifest:

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: myapp
  namespace: apps
spec:
  interval: 5m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: ./charts/myapp
      sourceRef:
        kind: GitRepository
        name: my-repo
        namespace: flux-system
  values: {}
  install:
    remediation:
      retries: 3
  upgrade:
    remediation:
      retries: 3
  # üëá Important
  suspend: false
You don't need to annotate the HelmRelease directly‚Äîyou‚Äôll configure alerting via an Alert resource.

2. üõéÔ∏è Create an Alert Resource
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Alert
metadata:
  name: helm-success-alert
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  summary: "HelmRelease ready"
  eventSeverity: info
  eventSources:
    - kind: HelmRelease
      name: myapp
      namespace: apps
  providerRef:
    name: helm-test-webhook
This tells Flux to emit events when myapp reconciles successfully.

3. üåê Create a Provider (Webhook Receiver)
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: helm-test-webhook
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  type: webhook
  address: http://your-ci-system.local/webhook
  secretRef:
    name: webhook-secret
This Provider will POST JSON to http://your-ci-system.local/webhook (your CI pipeline, Argo Workflow, GitHub Actions webhook, etc.).

You can point this to a GitHub Actions repository_dispatch or self-hosted runner endpoint.

4. üîê Create the Secret (Optional)
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: webhook-secret
  namespace: flux-system
stringData:
  address: http://your-ci-system.local/webhook
Only required if your webhook needs an authentication token.

5. ü§ñ Set Up a CI System to Run Helm Tests
For GitHub Actions, a sample repository_dispatch handler:

yaml
Copy
Edit
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [flux-helm-test]

jobs:
  run-helm-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Setup Helm
        uses: azure/setup-helm@v3

      - name: Run Helm Test
        run: |
          helm test myapp --namespace apps --logs
6. üß™ Trigger it!
Deploy the HelmRelease

Flux reconciles it

Notification Controller detects Ready=True

It POSTs to your webhook endpoint

Your CI system receives the payload and runs helm test

üß∞ Bonus: Filter for Only Successful Deploys
If you're worried about false triggers, you can set:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spec:
  eventSeverity: info
  suspend: false
Or listen for eventReason: ReconciliationSucceeded via webhook filters.

‚úÖ Summary
Step	Tool	Purpose
1	HelmRelease	Define your chart
2	Alert	Watches HelmRelease events
3	Provider	Defines webhook target
4	Webhook CI system	Runs helm test
5	Secret	Secures webhook (optional)

You said:
Interesting...so this seems like a lot of work and very complex. What am I really gaining here?


ChatGPT said:
You're asking the right question. Let's cut to the chase:

üß† What Are You Really Gaining from Helm Tests with Flux?
Using Helm tests with Flux and notification hooks can provide value‚Äîbut only in specific contexts. Here's a breakdown to help you decide if it's worth it for your situation.

‚úÖ When It's Worth It
Scenario	Why It's Worth It
Mission-critical services	You need to verify service health post-deploy, beyond just ‚ÄúPods Ready.‚Äù
No human eyes on dev/test clusters	Tests give you passive assurance that the deployment works in-cluster.
Automated promotion pipelines	You want to gate promotion to staging/prod on test success (e.g., progressive delivery).
Lightweight smoke tests	Quick HTTP checks, DB pings, or config validation in-cluster are cheap and useful.
You can't use external e2e test suites yet	Helm tests offer a simple fallback.

‚ùå When It's Overkill
Scenario	Why Not Worth It
You already use full e2e testing (e.g., K6, Postman, Cypress)	Those give better coverage and structure.
Your workloads are simple or internal tools	A failed Helm test adds little value‚Äîyou‚Äôll know if it‚Äôs broken.
You can just curl or health check in CI	You don‚Äôt need a Job in the cluster for that.
You don‚Äôt have a CI/CD pipeline that can handle webhooks easily	Adds complexity for questionable return.
You want a test suite with assert logic	Helm tests can‚Äôt assert; they pass/fail based on exit code only.

‚öñÔ∏è Pros vs Cons
Pros	Cons
Simple to define (helm.sh/hook: test)	Flux doesn‚Äôt run them ‚Äî you need automation
Runs in the cluster (true-to-life env)	Poor visibility/reporting unless CI glues it together
Useful for smoke tests or regressions	No granularity ‚Äî all tests run unless you build toggles
Declarative (in chart)	Jobs can fail silently unless you capture logs manually
Can block promotion in CI pipelines	Helm doesn‚Äôt retry/reconcile tests ‚Äî they run once

üß™ Example Worthwhile Helm Tests
curl http://myapp:8080/healthz ‚Üí makes sure service responds post-deploy

psql -c "SELECT 1" ‚Üí validates DB is up and reachable

python check_secrets.py ‚Üí validates config/secrets were mounted correctly

If that gives you confidence to go to prod, it‚Äôs worth automating.

üîß If You Do Want Helm Tests:
Keep it simple:

Write 1‚Äì2 meaningful smoke tests in your chart

Run them via a GitHub Action or shell script only on tagged environments (dev, qa, staging)

Use test results to gate downstream promotion

Don‚Äôt waste time wiring in fancy webhook orchestration unless:

You‚Äôre doing progressive delivery (canary, blue/green)

You want full GitOps automation, no human in loop

üß† TL;DR
Helm tests with Flux can be useful, but they don‚Äôt give you magical validation for free ‚Äî you still need to run them manually or automate around Flux. The effort is worth it if your deployments need confidence gates, but it's overkill for internal tools or when other CI checks do the same job.

Would you like help designing a minimal "just enough" test workflow for your existing Flux CI/CD setup?








You said:
How do people usually test flux helmreleases is there a better more common way of doing this?


ChatGPT said:
Great follow-up ‚Äî and yes, there is a more common and arguably more effective way to test Flux HelmRelease deployments than using Helm tests + hooks + webhooks.

‚úÖ How Do People Actually Test Flux HelmReleases in Practice?
üöÄ The Real-World Norm: External CI/CD + Functional Testing
Most teams using Flux don‚Äôt use helm test at all. Instead, they rely on external testing workflows tied to their GitOps flow:

üõ†Ô∏è Common Approaches (Ranked by Popularity)
#	Approach	Description
1Ô∏è‚É£	Pre-merge validation	Lint, dry-run, and validate Helm charts or Kustomizations before merge via CI (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
2Ô∏è‚É£	Post-sync smoke tests	After Flux reconciles a HelmRelease, trigger an external script or workflow to hit the service and confirm it's working
3Ô∏è‚É£	Kubernetes health + alerts	Rely on Kubernetes probes + Prometheus/Alertmanager to alert if something is broken post-deploy
4Ô∏è‚É£	Kustomize diff tools	Use tools like kubeval, kubeconform, kustomize build to catch errors in manifests before they hit the cluster
5Ô∏è‚É£	(Less common) helm test + Flux Notification Controller	As discussed, but more complex and niche

üîç Example Flow Most Teams Use
yaml
Copy
Edit
# CI: Before GitOps repo is updated
- Run `helm lint`
- Run `helm template` + `kubeval` or `kubeconform`
- Optional: `helm diff upgrade` to preview changes
- If tests pass, merge PR to GitOps repo

# Post-merge
- Flux reconciles `HelmRelease`
- CI runs health check (e.g., curl /healthz)
- Optional: Wait for rollout completion + smoke test
üß™ What About Real Application Testing?
Instead of using helm test, teams often:

Deploy to a preview environment (e.g., via feature branch)

Run integration tests using tools like:

curl / httpie

pytest or Postman Collections

Selenium/Cypress for frontend

Gate promotion to staging/prod based on those results

üîÑ Flux Reconciliation Checks
Flux CLI tools can help verify reconciliation:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Wait until HelmRelease has reconciled
flux reconcile hr my-release -n apps
flux get hr my-release -n apps --watch
You can then layer tests after that.

üß† TL;DR: What‚Äôs the ‚ÄúBest Practice‚Äù?
Thing	Recommendation
Unit tests	Run helm lint, helm template + kubeval
Smoke tests	Run outside cluster (or via Kubernetes Job you define yourself)
Helm tests	Rarely used with Flux ‚Äî not recommended unless you have special needs
CI checks	Gate PR merges or use repo dispatch events post-deploy
Health	Use Kubernetes probes, service monitors, or Blackbox exporters for runtime checks

Would you like a CI template for pre-merge HelmRelease validation or post-deploy smoke testing in GitHub Actions or another platform?








You said:
do all pods have a /healthz?


ChatGPT said:
Nope ‚Äî not all Pods have a /healthz endpoint. That path is not automatic or standardized by Kubernetes. It's:

Only present if the container explicitly implements it, and

Often used by convention, not by requirement

üß† Breakdown
‚úÖ When /healthz does exist:
Your app (or base image) implements it explicitly

Frameworks like:

Spring Boot ‚Üí /actuator/health

Express.js (Node) ‚Üí custom route like /healthz

Django ‚Üí you create a views.healthz route

Certain cloud-native tools (e.g., NGINX ingress, Prometheus exporters) ship with /healthz

‚ùå When it doesn‚Äôt exist:
Your app has no web server

You didn‚Äôt define a route called /healthz

The container doesn't expose any HTTP interface

üß™ Kubernetes Doesn‚Äôt Require /healthz
In Kubernetes, health checks are defined via liveness and readiness probes, and those can point anywhere, like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /status
    port: 8080
So if your container doesn‚Äôt expose /healthz, but you define /status, that‚Äôs perfectly fine.

‚úÖ How to Check if a Pod Has /healthz
You can:

Port-forward:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl port-forward pod/myapp-123 8080:8080
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
Or exec in and check what‚Äôs listening:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl exec -it myapp-123 -- curl -s localhost:8080/healthz
If you get a 404, the endpoint likely doesn't exist.

üîß What Should You Do?
If you're testing your app in CI or via Helm test:

‚úÖ Use whatever endpoint your app exposes

‚úÖ Document expected probe endpoints (/status, /ready, /health, etc.)

üö´ Don‚Äôt assume /healthz ‚Äî it‚Äôs not universal

Would you like a sample HTTP server in Go or Python that implements a /healthz and /ready endpoint for testing or CI?








You said:
I don't think helm testing is worth it for me. I want to do a big write up for a SPIKE page about why its not worth it.


ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs write a clear, professional SPIKE document summarizing your findings and rationale for not adopting Helm tests in your Flux-based GitOps setup.

üß™ SPIKE: Evaluating Helm Tests in a Flux GitOps Workflow
üìå Summary
This SPIKE evaluates the utility and integration cost of using Helm tests within our Flux GitOps deployment workflow. While Helm provides a native testing mechanism via helm test, this approach introduces complexity and limited value in the context of Flux. Based on research and analysis, we recommend not adopting Helm tests and instead relying on existing CI practices and post-deployment smoke testing strategies.

üß† Background
Helm allows chart maintainers to define Kubernetes Jobs annotated with helm.sh/hook: test. These tests can be manually run with helm test <release> to validate deployments. In a traditional Helm CLI-driven deployment, this can be used to verify service health, database readiness, or configuration correctness.

Flux CD, however, does not run Helm tests automatically. It uses the Helm SDK for reconciliation but ignores test hooks, requiring additional automation to run them out-of-band.

‚öôÔ∏è Integration Options Considered
To incorporate Helm tests into our Flux deployment flow, we considered:

Using Flux Notification Controller to detect HelmRelease reconciliation success

Triggering a CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions) via a webhook to run helm test

Parsing test logs and failures via external tooling

Each of these adds significant architectural overhead and maintenance complexity.

‚ùå Why Helm Tests Are Not a Good Fit
Reason	Details
Not natively supported in Flux	Requires separate automation just to invoke tests
Manual orchestration required	Must use CI pipelines or custom webhooks to trigger tests
Limited reporting/logging	Helm test output isn‚Äôt surfaced in Flux logs or dashboards
No support for selective test execution	You must run all test hooks at once; can‚Äôt filter
Not easily integrated into GitOps PR-based workflows	Helm tests only run post-deploy, not pre-merge
Better alternatives exist	External smoke tests or app-level readiness/liveness probes are more flexible and visible

‚úÖ Recommended Alternatives
Approach	Benefit
Pre-merge CI validation (helm lint, template, kubeconform)	Catch errors before they reach the cluster
Post-deploy smoke testing via CI	Test live endpoints or APIs after Flux deploys
Kubernetes probes and observability	Use liveness/readiness probes + Prometheus/Grafana/Alertmanager for runtime health
Manual testing or ad-hoc jobs in dev	For exploratory testing, write jobs without Helm hook overhead

üí° Conclusion
Helm tests, while conceptually useful, do not integrate cleanly with our Flux-based GitOps model. The added complexity of wiring them into CI pipelines, the limited visibility into test results, and the lack of flexibility in their execution make them a poor fit for our needs. Instead, we will continue to rely on:

Pre-deploy validation in CI

Runtime health checks (Kubernetes probes + metrics)

Post-deploy endpoint verification via lightweight smoke testing

This approach provides higher confidence with less operational complexity.

You said:
what is the most common means of smoke testing cluster services


ChatGPT said:
The most common and effective means of smoke testing cluster services in Kubernetes-based environments (like AKS, EKS, GKE) typically combine external CI tools, lightweight HTTP checks, and sometimes on-cluster Jobs. Here's how most teams do it:

‚úÖ Most Common Smoke Testing Strategies for Cluster Services
1. External CI/CD Test After Deploy (Most Common)
üß∞ Tools: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Argo Workflows, Jenkins, CircleCI
‚úÖ Good For: GitOps workflows (e.g., Flux, ArgoCD), staged deployments

Typical Flow:
Flux or Argo deploys the HelmRelease

CI job runs:

curl or httpie to hit /healthz, /ready, or /api/ping

Verifies response code (200 OK, etc.)

Optional JSON/schema check on payload

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -sf http://my-service.namespace.svc.cluster.local/healthz || exit 1
Can be run:

In CI pipeline

From a test pod in the cluster

From a sidecar or monitoring container

2. In-Cluster Smoke Test via Kubernetes Job
üß∞ Tools: kubectl, Helm chart templates, Kustomize

Create a simple Job that runs a smoke test container (e.g., busybox, curlimages/curl, alpine) that hits your service:

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: smoke-test
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: tester
        image: curlimages/curl
        args: ["-f", "http://my-service/healthz"]
      restartPolicy: Never
‚úÖ Pros:

Runs inside the cluster (realistic)

Useful for private/internal services

‚ùå Cons:

Must manage lifecycle of test Job (cleanup)

Not automatically integrated into Helm or Flux flows

3. Readiness/Liveness Probes (Passive Smoke Testing)
üß∞ Native Kubernetes feature

yaml
Copy
Edit
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
These don‚Äôt replace testing, but act as runtime sanity checks that Kubernetes uses to control service availability.

Used in conjunction with:

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

Ingress routing

Rollout readiness

4. Blackbox Exporter or Custom Prometheus Checks
üß∞ Tools: Prometheus Blackbox Exporter

Define a probe in Prometheus that checks:

HTTP/S response

TCP port open

DNS resolution

‚úÖ Great for monitoring and alerting, especially in production.

5. Service Mesh Probes (Istio, Linkerd)
If you're using a service mesh:

Can perform synthetic traffic generation

Run health probes through the mesh

See telemetry on response codes, errors, latency

üß† Most Teams Do This:
text
Copy
Edit
‚úÖ Pre-merge CI (helm lint, dry run)
‚úÖ Post-deploy CI smoke test (curl healthz/API)
‚úÖ K8s probes for runtime safety
‚úÖ Prometheus alerting on 5xx or downtime
This is a layered defense model, ensuring both build-time and runtime health.

‚úÖ Example GitHub Action Step
yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Smoke Test Service
  run: |
    for i in {1..5}; do
      curl -sf http://my-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local/healthz && exit 0
      sleep 5
    done
    echo "Smoke test failed!"
    exit 1
Would you like a library of reusable smoke test jobs or CI examples you can drop into your GitOps workflow?
